# My-Bad-L33TCode

- Repo to store my poor attempts at l33tcode. Feel free to use them as reference, i've included the performance information. I'm sure you can do better!
- Using l33tcode problems in interviewing processes might sound like a good idea, but it really isn't. It's like asking someone to solve a crossword puzzle to prove that they know how to drive a snowplow, sure it might be a snowplow themed crossword, but in the real world it doesn't prove alot.
- On the subject of crosswords, l33tcode taken in the same way as a crossword puzzles can be quite fun, but as a job interview device i have my doubts.
